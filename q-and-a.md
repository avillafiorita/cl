Instructions:

-   Post your question and doubts by opening an issue on the [cl-2020
    repository](https://github.com/avillafiorita/cl-2020) on Github,
    where this website is hosted, **on the Thursday before** the
    lesson in which you want to discuss your question. To avoid useless
    work on both sides, make sure you **check the open issues before
    posting a new question**. Note that you might need to register on
    GitHub, if you don\'t have an account.
-   Questions will be processed from the oldest to the most recent
    lesson
