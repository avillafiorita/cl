If you have any question, do not hesitate and ask us, either by
sending an email, by stopping at the end of the lesson, or by asking
for a meeting.

In general, **email** is the most effective communication mean, since
it gives us time to dedicate time and dedicate more time and attention
to the answer.  (After the lesson we might be on a rush to get to the
next lesson or to the next appointment in our agenda.)

Please **allow for one week** from question to answer.  It is a lot
better to wait for a few days and get a proper answer, than have
immediate responses which might require further refining and work on
both sides.

We also welcome and invite you to provide any kind of **feedback**.
If you have any suggestions on how to improve the website, materials,
and course, please get in touch.  The only constraint is **being
constructive**: critics are OK, but not if they are just for the sake
of it.

The [Contacts](contacts.html) page contain information on how to
reach us.
