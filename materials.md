# Materials 

This page contains references and materials on the topics taught in the
course. There are many, many courses covering mathematical logic: if you
find interesting resources not listed here, please open an issue on
Github, so that we can improve this page.

# Online Tools

-   [LogicTools on
    Datascientia](http://datascientia.education/logictools/) local
    instance of the Logic Tools, where you can have PL and FOL problems
    solved. The tools are more relevant for PL than for FOL.
-   [Tree Proof Generator](https://www.umsu.de/trees/) builds Tableaux
    for PL and FOL.

# Moodle page

-   UNITN enables Moodle instances, while the course is running.
    If you are enrolled in the course, you can visit the
    [CL 2022 Moodle Page at UNITN](https://didatticaonline.unitn.it/dol/enrol/index.php?id=24456)

# Previous Editions of the Course

-   [CL-2020](https://datascientia.education/cl-2020) hosts the previous
    edition of the course and it might be useful for exercises, **although we
    are making the effort of moving all materials to this website**.  Keep
    also in mind that the materials have been revised and some topics, most
    notably Modal Logics, are no longer relevant.

# External Materials covering topics taught in CL-2022

You might try using these materials to get a different approach to
explaining the topics we cover in the course. Notice that these
materials might not cover topics we cover in CL-2022 and, viceversa,
explore topics we are not covering in this course.

-   [Introduction to AI at
    Cornell](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4700/2011fa/) as a
    lesson dedicated to
    [FOL](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4700/2011fa/lectures/16_FirstOrderLogic.pdf),
    which includes a very short tutorial on Prolog.
-   [First-Order Logic -Syntax, Semantics,
    Resolution](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/piskac/teaching/decpro-729/fol.pdf)
    is another introduction to FOL in the form of slides.
-   The [Seminar on Automated Reasoning at
    TUM](https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/sar/SS20/) has material to
    read on various topics, including [Tableaux for
    FOL](https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/sar/SS20/2.pdf).
-   The [Logic
    Notes](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~jks/LogicNotes/index.html)
    pages focuses on (natural) deduction, but it has a lesson on
    [Tableaux](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~jks/LogicNotes/quantifiers-in-tableaux.html).
-   [First-Order
    Tableau](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/fileadmin/inf/rg1/script8ws1617.pdf)
    is a chapter from a book, probably, covering Tableaux for FOL.
-   [Tableeuax for first order
    logic](http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/liberato/planning/tableau/ground.html)
    at the University of Roma is a step-by-step example of Tableaux with
    term substitution. Part of the [Planning and
    reasoning](http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/liberato/planning/) course by
    Paolo Liberatore.

A very detailed and clear discussion about the formalization of
constraints on terms satisfying a formula (exactly ..., at most ...,
execpt ...):

-   [More about
    Quantification](https://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/120/Chapter14.pdf)
    at the University of Washington (Full set of [lecture
    notes](https://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/120/LectureNotes.htm)).

# Exercises on topics covered in CL-2022

-   [Introduction to Logic](https://logic.umwblogs.org/) is a blog and
    course on logic, with highlights on logical fallacies in informal
    reasoning. It also has various interesting exercises on informal to
    formal: [I2F for
    PL](https://logic.umwblogs.org/symbolic-logic/exercises-translation-practice-in-propositional-logic/)
    and [I2F for FOL](https://logic.umwblogs.org/predicate-logic/).
-   [Exercises on
    satisfiability](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~larrosa/MEI-CSI-files/SAT/SAT-exercises.pdf)
    and [Exercises on PL, FOL, Set
    Theory](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1112/DiscMathI/exercises.pdf)
-   The [Logic in Computer Science
    (COMP118)](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frank/teaching/comp118/comp118.html)
    course has various exercises, which you can find, for instance,
    here: [Lecture
    4](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frank/teaching/comp118/lecture4.pdf),
    [Tutorial
    1](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frank/teaching/comp118/tutorial1.pdf),
    [Test
    1](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frank/teaching/comp118/test2013a.pdf).
    If you are interested in the topic, you might also have a look at
    the
    [Material](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frank/teaching/comp118/material.html)
    page, where you can find some nice resources.

The following focus Description Logic:

-   [Description
    Logic](https://lat.inf.tu-dresden.de/teaching/ws2013-2014/DL/sheet-01.pdf)
    at TUD
-   [DL
    Exercises](https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Book%3A_An_Introduction_to_Ontology_Engineering_(Keet)/04%3A_Description_Logics/4.E%3A_Description_Logics_(Exercises))
    at Libre Books
-   [Mathematical Logic
    Exercises](http://disi.unitn.it/~ldkr/ml2014/ExercisesBooklet.pdf)
    at DISI has various exercises on Description Logic (which is part
    of CL-2022) and Modal Logic (which is **not** part of CL-2022).

The following focus on Modal Logic, which, however, is **not** part of CL-2022

-   [Phil 511 at UMASS,

# Books

A very nice website is:

-   [Open Logic Project](https://openlogicproject.org/) which collects
    many resources and textbooks covering logic.

They might have exercises at the end of each chapter:

-   [Introduction to Mathematical
    Logic](https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/mendelson.pdf)
    (Elliott Mendelson)
-   [A Concise IntroductiontoMathematical
    Logic](http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/raut/logic3/announce.pdf)
    (Wolfgang Rautenberg)
