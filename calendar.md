You might want to read the [Instructions](./instructions) to
understand how to take the course. (And the expression \"you might want
...\" gets translated in Italian with: \"Ã¨ assolutamente necessario che
...\".)

Notice also the titles and structure of the lessons yet to be delivered
might change slightly . The rule of the thumb is: if there are links
with materials, things won\'t change; if there are no links to the
materials, titles and content are just suggestions.
