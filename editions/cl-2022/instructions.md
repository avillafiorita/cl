# Instructions

The Fall 2022 Edition of Computational Logic is delivered in class.

This page recaps the resources available to support your participation
to the course and some suggestions on how to learn and pass the exam
with satisfaction and success.

## Resources

There are basically three kinds of resources you can use to study:

- **This website**
  ([https://datascientia.education/cl](https://datascientia.education/cl))
  and the pages specific to this edition of the course
  ([https://datascientia.education/cl/editions/cl-2022/](https://datascientia.education/cl/editions/cl-2022/)),
  which contains **slides** and other support materials, such as
  **videos of the lessons**.
  
  Slides are usually made available before the lesson,
  while video are uploaded usually no more than one week after the
  lesson (this is, at least, our target).

  More about the structure of the website below.
 
- **The Moodle website**
  ([https://didatticaonline.unitn.it/dol/enrol/index.php?id=34489](https://didatticaonline.unitn.it/dol/enrol/index.php?id=34489)),
  which is used for communications and for posting quizzes and tests.
  
  Moodle is also used for mid-term and the final exams.  All
  interesting materials on the Moodle website are also highlighted and
  linked from this website.
  
- **External resources**, listed at the end of each page with
  materials about a specific concept.

  The _external resources_ page might be useful if you wish to dig
  deeper into the subject, wish to study using a support book, or test
  your knowledge on additional tests.
  
## Tips

Logic is a tricky subject: many concepts might seem clear and
simple, till you realize you probably did not understand a damn
thing.

So here are some suggestions:
  
- Try and keep the pace of the course, remaining up-to-date with the
  lessons and materials.  **In our experiences, failing to do so, will
  probably end up with you getting lost after a few lessons and making
  attendance less useful.**
- When you study, focus and **think about the "why" of ... everything
  you read!**.  Imagine **counterexamples**.  Try and **break**
  everything: definitions, theorems, examples.  Play **"what if"
  scenarios**.  Follow up on the consequences of changing or breaking
  one or more of the hypotheses on which a specific concept is based.
- **Ask, ask, ask.** Check with your **peers** whether you are on the
  same line. Organize study groups.
- **Ask, ask, ask.** Check with your **teachers**, make sure there are
  no doubts about materials and lessons. Check the [Question and
  Answers Page](q-and-a.html) the practicalities here.

## Structure of this website

This year (2022), we decided to profoundly restructure content and
website.

Concerning the content, a new set of curated slides will simplify
studying and learning.

Concerning the website, we now distinguish between **materials** and
**editions** of the course:

- **Materials** don't change very often, save small fixes and
  improvements.  They are slides and other resources presented in
  specific editions of the course.
  
  Notice that not all materials might be required for a specific
  edition of Computational Logic, although this will be the exception
  rather than the rule and will certainly **not apply** to the 2022
  edition, where all the published materials will be used.  In any
  case, we will make sure to clearly highlight which material belongs
  to which edition.
  
- **Editions** contain information about current (and previous)
  editions of the course: the planned lessons, the actual delivery
  plan, links to the materials actually presented, Q&A specific to a
  given edition.
  
The sidebar on the left makes clear which page is which. 

> Notice that, since we started the restructuring of the website in
> 2022, the materials pages will be incrementally filled with content
> as we move along the course.  (This will be no longer true from
> Autumn 2023, when all the materials will be curated and uploaded.)

We welcome **feedback**.  If you have any suggestion on how to improve
the website and the material, please get in touch.
